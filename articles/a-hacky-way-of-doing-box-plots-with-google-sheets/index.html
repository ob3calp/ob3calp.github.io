                <p>What I love about Google Sheets is that it's easy to use, shareable and portable. With it's simplicity comes a downside - it's not very customizable. I recently tried doing box plots with it and discovered that there wasn't a built-in solution for them.</p>
                <p>One of the most common ways to emulate box plots in Google Sheets is by using a candlestick chart. The downside is that you're omitting one of the most important values, the median. Another hacky way is to use a stacked bar chart. But it's nowhere near the intuitive look of a real box plot.</p></p>
                <p>Going through numerous Google searches didn't reveal any good alternatives. At first I thought about using Google Apps Script, but then found a hacky way of doing it inside the spreadsheet.</p> <p>With line charts!</p>

                <p>Sometimes one image is more descriptive than a bunch of words:</p>

                    <figcaption>

                <p>From the image above you can already start piece together how to go about doing your own box plot.</p>
                <p>Doing outliers (any values farther than 1.5 x IQR of 1st and 3rd quartiles) and variable width (width of a box plot depends on it's sample size) is pretty easy. I've linked some spreadsheet examples below.</p>
